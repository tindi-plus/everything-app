# Feed Pagination with Firebase Firestore and Riverpod

This repository demonstrates an efficient implementation of paginated feed loading using Firebase Firestore as the backend and Riverpod for state management in Flutter. 

The code is designed to handle large datasets by fetching posts in small batches, displaying them in a user-friendly interface, and ensuring smooth scrolling for an optimized user experience. 


- **Firebase Firestore**: Fetch posts in real-time with pagination.
- **Riverpod**: Manage state and streamline business logic for clean architecture.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically fetch new data as users scroll.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Retry mechanisms in case of network failures.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Batch fetching with customizable limits.

- `lib/models/post_model.dart`: Data model representing a post.
- `lib/providers/feed_provider.dart`: Riverpod provider for managing feed state.
- `lib/ui/feed_screen.dart`: UI implementation for the paginated feed.


### Why This Code Stands Out

1. **Demonstrates Advanced Usage**: Efficiently handles pagination using Riverpod, Firestore, and `infinite_scroll_pagination`.
2. **Optimized UI Rendering**: Smart use of `ProviderScope` ensures efficient rebuilds.
3. **Error Resilience**: Clear strategies for handling connectivity issues and other errors.
4. **Clean and Modular**: Easily understandable, scalable, and maintainable structure.

This code snippet highlights my ability to solve practical challenges in a scalable, user-focused manner.
