# FeedScreen Documentation

## Overview
The `FeedScreen` is a Flutter widget that represents a feed screen in a social media application. It displays a list of posts fetched from Firestore and allows users to interact with the content.

## State Management
The `FeedScreen` uses the Riverpod state management library to manage its state. It is implemented as a `ConsumerStatefulWidget`, allowing it to listen to changes in the state and rebuild the UI accordingly.

## Pagination
Pagination is implemented using the `PagingController` from the `infinite_scroll_pagination` package. The screen fetches posts in chunks, allowing for efficient loading of data as the user scrolls.

## User Interaction
The screen listens to scroll events to show or hide the navigation bar based on the user's scroll direction. This enhances the user experience by providing a cleaner interface when scrolling through posts.

## Error Handling
The `FeedScreen` includes error handling for network issues. If there is a problem retrieving posts, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.

## UI Components
The main UI components of the `FeedScreen` include:
- **AppBar**: Displays the application logo.
- **LiquidPullToRefresh**: Allows users to refresh the list of posts.
- **PagedListView**: Displays the list of posts with pagination support.
- **Error Indicators**: Shows messages when there is an error retrieving data.

## Dependencies
- **feed_provider.dart**: This file manages the data fetching and state for the feed.
- **post_widget.dart**: This file is used to display individual posts in the feed.
